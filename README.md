# Task 5

Design the simplest vector graphic editor. Prepare class layouts reflecting the structure of the future project.

Functional requirements for the mock-up are as follows:

* Creating a new document
* Importing a document from a file
* Exporting a document to a file
* Creating a graphic primitive
* Deleting a graphic primitive

Focus primarily on the controller template (MVC) and polymorphism. Gather GUI handler functions in one file with the main function. Attention should be given to declarations; implementation is only necessary for minimal demonstration of required calls. The project must compile, and all headers must pass the compilation stage. The assignment is considered successful if all files compile, all classes are covered by diagrams, and the code successfully passes analysis.

## Additional Recommendations

1. Incorporate the use of smart pointers in interfaces to manage object ownership.
2. Keep the single responsibility principle in mind and divide the code into logical modules (classes, functions).
3. Avoid code duplication.
